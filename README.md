Start with Copied files from V.0

@workspace can you create the following files in the root folder:

- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- .prettierrc
- .eslintrc.json
- .eslintignore
- .prettierignore
- .gitignore
- .env.example
- .vercelignore

To install packages, extract the dependencies from the package.json and get them as "individual commands to install the latest versions of all these dependencies 1 by 1". Delete the packages shown in the package.json and then install all the dependencies from the console.
